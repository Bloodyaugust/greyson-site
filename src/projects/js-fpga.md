# JS FPGA

The hotness around Machine Learning is all tensors and convolutional filters, which are awesome! This project explores a different strategy, called Genetic and Evolutionary Programming, or "Genetic Algorithms". Mostly it's for fun, but I think it's a valuable tool in helping to make understanding of ML easier for those of us that are less... math-inclined.

The project can be found [on my github](https://github.com/Bloodyaugust/js-fpga).
