# Bobot Battle

A turn-based, arena-combat, multiplayer game based on the boardgame Robo Rally. It technically works, but NAT punching is hard, so ports need to be forwarded.

The game can be downloaded [on itch.io](https://synsugarstudio.itch.io/bobot-battle), and the source (is here)[https://github.com/Bloodyaugust/bobot-battle].
