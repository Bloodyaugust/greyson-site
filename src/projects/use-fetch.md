# use-fetch

A simple, *safe* fetch custom hook for React. This hook helps you avoid mutating state on components that are `unmounted` by providing you with the `mounted` state of the hook, and aborts in-flight requests on `unmount`. It also does a bunch of other cool stuff.

This "library" can be found [on my github](https://github.com/Bloodyaugust/use-fetch).
