# Phaser Template

This project serves as a template and explainer for using PhaserV3 with ES6 syntax, React for UI, CastleDB for data, and Parcel for local development and builds, with continuous integration for Github Pages through Github Actions.

The "game" can be played on [my github](https://bloodyaugust.github.io/phaser-template/), and the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Bloodyaugust/phaser-template).
