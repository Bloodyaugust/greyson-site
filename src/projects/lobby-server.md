# Lobby Server

Intended for use as a lightweight lobby for games, using the 4 character lobby ID pattern, and a configurable timeout with a lobby cleaning function. It's not production ready so please don't use it.

The project can be found [on my github](https://github.com/Bloodyaugust/lobby-server).
